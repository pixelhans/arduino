# arduino

The 3rd and last project for our class. We were asked to create a simple litte arduino project with the topic "binary state".

I created a little compass device, that allows you to locate north and the northpole. All you need is an arduino an a little compass device. 

Adding 3d mode to locate the northpole was an idea of a friend of mine. Together we looked into it and created this little special compass by modifying an existing .ino-file.
